 * ISO/IEC JTC1 SC22 WG21 P0260R3 C++ Concurrent Queues
 *
 * This differs from P0260R3 in that:

//! Represents a thread-safe std::set. Because a set can only ever hold
/// a single copy of an item, this provides a basic de-duplication
/// service.
///
/// This implements a thread-safe set: any thread can insert stuff into
/// the set, and any other thread can remove stuff from it.  If the set
/// is empty, the thread attempting to remove stuff will block.  If the
/// set is empty, and something is added to the set, and there is
/// some thread blocked on the set, then that thread will be woken up.
///
/// The function provided here is almost identical to that provided by
/// the concurrent_stack/concurrent_queue classes (in this directory)
/// except that the class behaves like a set: an item can be inserted
/// into the set many times, and, if its not removed, then it will only
/// ever appear in it once.  In essence, it avoids redundancy, as
/// compared to items placed in a queue/stack.
///
/// In other respects, it behaves like the concurrent queue/stack
/// classes: when an item is gotten, it is removed (erased) from the set.
/// It employes the same cancellation and condition-wait mechanisms
/// as those classes, thus ensuring proper concurrency.
///
/// The Element class must have an std::less associated with it, as that
/// is used to determine if an element is already in the set.  When
/// getting elements from the set, they will be gotten from the "front",
/// i.e. based on what std::less returned.  This means that there are no
/// round-robin or "fair" fetching guarantees of any sort; in fact, the
/// gets are guaranteed to NOT be fair.  This may result in unexpected
/// behavior.
